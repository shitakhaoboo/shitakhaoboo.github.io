                <h3>MEKATILILI FELLOWSHIP</h3>
                <p> The Mekatilili fellowship offered opportunities for student engineers and tech enthusiasts to not only get exposed to real world problems but also to actively participate in solving them.
                    There were three tracks offered up, all being site visits to the key players whose contributions made the fellowship a success. The three tracks were inclusive of team Agriculture with a site visit to Twiga Foods,the Accessibility team with a site Assocaition for the Physically disabled of Kenya 
                    and team manufacturing which had a site visit to AB3D
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was honoured to be among the team that visited the Twiga foods offices. This was an eye-opener as it was my actual first site visit with a client debrief to get a feel of the needs and expectations of the client.
                </p>
                    After a thorough assessment of the premises and informal interviews carried out on the employees, we came up with four major areas that required addressing<br>
                    <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
                        <li>Uncontrolled cold room access: <br>This was such that the ideal ripening and storage conditions for the commodities were constantly interfered with</li>
                        <li>Power wastage by older cold rooms:<br>The older cold rooms run under manual monitoring and reporting hence the continued interference with ideal conditions. This also led to power wastage</li>
                        <li>Mechanical Commodity damage during transit: <br>Many commodities gotphysical damage(bruises) during transit hence lowering the quality and market value </li>
                        <li>Communication constraint between clientele  and Twiga foods</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>
                    I actively contributed and led a team as the hardware developer in prototyping and testing a viable solutions for the former two. The general idea was to have unique keys in order to access the coldrooms, what we accomplished by using rfid identifiers while using sensor data to automate operation of the older coldrooms.

                <h5>Introduction</h5>
                <p>
                        The Jua Kali sector in the country is a business field which incorporates wholesomely the production and distribution chain. This, encompassing procurement, manufacturing and production as well as sales. In light of this, it is paramount to have a firm understanding of the basic operation of this sector. Over and above this, there is an even greater need for technical skills among the present influx of a young and vibrant population comprising of youth, who have ended up on the Jua kali sector, with trainings conducted informally and unregulated in way of apprenticeship. There is also the need for consistency in the various products produced with regards to quality, appearance and the general feel of the products. An even greater challenge arises in light of existing business owners who have been in the trade for quite some time, having reaped the fruits of this line of business as well as having seen the upsides and the downsides of Jua kali trade. In light of various benefits of an empowered Jua Kali industry such as the expansion of businesses, creation of more employment opportunities and introduction of better production processes, just to mention but a few, it is paramount that business owners are incorporated into the program.

                    <p>clock The experience within the period of the fellowship, has been phenomenal just to say the least. I received important insight in the areas of Machine learning and Artificial intelligence, which is beyond the expanded meanings as per the initials(AI and ML). This has stirred up an interest within these areas, that I would currently desire to customise and integrate them  for technological solutions I shall be a part of moving forward.
