                       makatilili The experience within the period of the fellowship, has been phenomenal just to say the least. I received important insight in the areas of Machine learning and Artificial intelligence, which is beyond the expanded meanings as per the initials(AI and ML). This has stirred up an interest within these areas, that I would currently desire to customise and integrate them  for technological solutions I shall be a part of moving forward.

                        It has also been a fulfilling experience working with new hardware components during the prototyping sessions, very well complementing my passion for Hardware programming and embedded systems engineering. It's been an exciting opportunity to work with other talented individuals in coming up with relevant solutions to specific problems we identified.
